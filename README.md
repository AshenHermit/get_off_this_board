# Get Off This Board
This program i wrote for electronic school board, it acts like a malware, remotely closes browser and creating fullscreen webview with glitch effects and some animated pages, or it can just play music with random videos on the background.  
In short, main purpose for this is to close browser, which probably is playing some shitty music, and play music that i want.
